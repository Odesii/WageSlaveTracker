# Corpo Tracker
*Remember, skipping this README is like ignoring the warning label on a firework—surprisingly common and mildly entertaining for bystanders.*

## Overview
**Corpo Tracker** allows you to view and edit a treasure trove of corporate drones—err, I mean employees—their overseers (managers), and the whole tedious structure of corporate roles and departments. Perfect for those who have nothing better to do or for those plotting their next bureaucratic coup.

## Features
- **Employee Manipulation:** Add, update, or terminate—I mean, remove employees. Handle them as the soulless numbers they are in your database.
- **Managerial Oversight:** Track who's bossing whom. Change the hierarchy just for fun and watch the chaos unfold.
- **Departmental Sorting:** Sort and filter through departments as if they truly mattered.
- **Role Assignment:** Assign roles as if you're directing a play where everyone is miscast.

Honestly, it's better for both of us if you don't try to contact me. If you're desperate, scream into the void; it's just as effective.
